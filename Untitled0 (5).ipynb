        "Odinal level--You can categorize and rank your data in an order, but you cannot say anything about the intervals between the rankings.\n",
        "Although you can rank the top 5 Olympic medallists, this scale does not tell you how close or far apart they are in number of wins.\n",

        "Top 5 Olympic medallists\n",
        "Language ability (e.g., beginner, intermediate, fluent)\n",
        "Likert-type questions  (e.g., very dissatisfied to very satisfied)\n",

        "Interval level--you can categorize, rank, and infer equal intervals between neighboring data points, but there is no true zero point.\n",
        "The difference between any two adjacent temperatures is the same: one degree. But  zero degrees is defined differently depending on the scale – it doesn’t mean an absolute absence of temperature.\n",
        "\n",
        "The same is true for test scores and personality inventories. A zero on a test is arbitrary; it does not mean that the test-taker has an absolute lack of the trait being measured.\n",

        "Test scores (e.g., IQ or exams)\n",
        "Personality inventories\n",
        "Temperature in Fahrenheit or Celsius\n",

        "Ratio level--You can categorize, rank, and infer equal intervals between neighboring data points, and there is a true zero point.\n",
        "A true zero means there is an absence of the variable of interest. In ratio scales, zero does mean an absolute lack of the variable.\n",
        "\n",

        "Ans2:- Measures of central tendency help you find the middle, or the average, of a dataset. The 3 most common measures of central tendency are the mode, median, and mean.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mode: the most frequent value.\n",
        "\n",
        "Median: the middle number in an ordered dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mean: the sum of all values divided by the total number of values.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans3:- Variance: The average squared deviation from the mean of the given data set is known as the variance. This measure of dispersion checks the spread of the data about the mean. Standard Deviation: The square root of the variance gives the standard deviation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans4:- A boxplot is a graph that gives a visual indication of how a data set's 25th percentile, 50th percentile, 75th percentile, minimum, maximum and outlier values are spread out and compare to each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans5:- It is a statistical technique to select a representative subset of individuals or items from a larger population. This method involves selecting individuals or entities randomly, which means each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected for the sample.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans6:- Skewness is a statistical measure that describes the asymmetry of a probability distribution. It helps in analyzing the data by providing insights into the shape and nature of the distribution. Skewness indicates whether the data is symmetric or skewed to one side.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans7:- The outliers may suggest experimental errors, variability in a measurement, or an anomaly. The age of a person may wrongly be recorded as 200 rather than 20 Years. Such an outlier should definitely be discarded from the dataset. However, not all outliers are bad. Some outliers signify that data is significantly different from others. For example, it may indicate an anomaly like bank fraud or a rare disease.\n",
        "\n",
        "IQR is used to measure variability by dividing a data set into quartiles. The data is sorted in ascending order and split into 4 equal parts. Q1, Q2, Q3 called first, second and third quartiles are the values which separate the 4 equal parts.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q1 represents the 25th percentile of the data.\n",
        "Q2 represents the 50th percentile of the data.\n",
        "Q3 represents the 75th percentile of the data.\n",
        "If a dataset has 2n or 2n+1 data points, then\n",
        "Q2 = median of the dataset.\n",
        "Q1 = median of n smallest data points.\n",
        "Q3 = median of n highest data points.\n",
        "\n",
        "IQR is the range between the first and the third quartiles namely Q1 and Q3: IQR = Q3 – Q1. The data points which fall below Q1 – 1.5 IQR or above Q3 + 1.5 IQR are outliers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans8:- The binomial distribution describes the behavior of a count variable X if the following conditions apply: 1: The number of observations n is fixed. 2: Each observation is independent. 3: Each observation represents one of two outcomes (\"success\" or \"failure\").\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans9:- The empirical rule, or the 68-95-99.7 rule, tells you where most of the values lie in a normal distribution: Around 68% of values are within 1 standard deviation of the mean. Around 95% of values are within 2 standard deviations of the mean. Around 99.7% of values are within 3 standard deviations of the mean\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans10:- Call centers use the Poisson distribution to model the number of expected calls per hour that they’ll receive so they know how many call center reps to keep on staff.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, suppose a given call center receives 10 calls per hour. We can use a Poisson distribution calculator to find the probability that a call center receives 0, 1, 2, 3 … calls in a given hour:\n",
        "\n",
        "P(X = 0 calls) = 0.00005\n",
        "P(X = 1 call) = 0.00045\n",
        "P(X = 2 calls) = 0.00227\n",
        "P(X = 3 calls) = 0.00757\n",
        "\n",
        "Example 2--For example, suppose a given restaurant receives an average of 100 customers per day. We can use the Poisson distribution calculator to find the probability that the restaurant receives more than a certain number of customers:\n",
        "\n",
        "P(X > 110 customers) = 0.14714\n",
        "P(X > 120 customers) = 0.02267\n",
        "P(X > 130 customers) = 0.00171\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans11:- Discrete random variables can only take on a finite number of values. For example, the outcome of rolling a die is a discrete random variable, as it can only land on one of six possible numbers. Continuous random variables, on the other hand, can take on any value in a given interval.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans12:- Covariance and Correlation are terms used in statistics to measure relationships between two random variables. Both of these terms measure linear dependency between a pair of random variables or bivariate data. They both capture a different component of the relationship, despite the fact that they both provide information about the link between variables. Let’s investigate the theory underlying correlation and covariance:\n",
        "\n",
        "We can discuss some of the main difference between them as below:In this article, we are going to discuss cov(), cor() and cov2cor() functions in R which use covariance and correlation methods of statistics and probability theory.\n",
        "\n",
        "In R programming, covariance can be measured using the cov() function. Covariance is a statistical term used to measure the direction of the linear relationship between the data vectors. Mathematically,\n"
